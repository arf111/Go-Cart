## Machine Learning Technique

In procedure 6, we used a machine learning technique called linear regression to
predict the sales outcome for any month.
Our dataset includes 2 columns (Month = x, Sales = y). So for month, x = 1, 2â€¦12
we inserted sales value y.
Then we calculated values by using the regression formula for a and b. Then for
any month, x = 1 = January we calculated y = a + bx and found the predicted
score.
